## 🔐 Authentication & Multi-Tenant Flow

- First signup creates a **Tenant** and sets the user as **Admin**.
- Admin completes **Company Setup**.
- Admin invites members from **Team Page**.
- Invite is sent via email with a secure token.
- New members sign up via the invite link and are **auto-linked** to the tenant with assigned roles.
- RLS ensures that users only access their own tenant data.

### 1️⃣ Two-Step Company Sign-Up

1. **Create Account** – An admin first signs up with email & password or a magic link.
2. **Setup Company** – After verifying email, the admin completes company onboarding:
   - **Company Name** (unique slug auto-generated)
   - **Your Full Name** (optional; defaults to email prefix)

Once complete, a tenant row is created in the `tenants` table and the admin’s profile is inserted with the `admin` role in the `members` table.

---

### 2️⃣ Invite Team Members

- From the **Team** page (`/dashboard/team`), admins can send invites.
- Each invite generates a secure, time-limited email link.

---

### 3️⃣ Member Sign-Up

- Invited users click their email link, landing on **Member Signup Page**.
- They create their account and are automatically linked to the correct tenant in the `members` table.

---

### 4️⃣ Team Management

- The **Team** page lists all members in a data table (sortable & responsive).

---

**Step by step flow**:  
`Admin Signup` → `Verify` → `Company Setup` → `Invite Member` → `Accept Invite` → `Member Signup` → `Login & Use Oclona`

---

## 🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access Control

| Role          | Capabilities                                              |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**     | Full control over tenant, invites, analytics, and data    |
| **Manager**   | Manage features like onboarding flows (under development) |
| **Employee**  | Limited access, can view assigned data and submit forms   |
| **Recruiter** | Dedicated to recruitment activities (future scope)        |

---

## 🛡️ Security & Data Isolation

- All tenant-specific data is isolated using Supabase **RLS Policies**.
- Users can only access records belonging to their tenant.
- Certain privileged actions like **invite creation** use **Supabase Edge Functions** with `service_role`.
- Files (images, PDFs) are stored securely in **Supabase Storage** with path references in the database.

## 📸 Screenshots

Screenshots or UI previews will be added soon.
